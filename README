Instructions for processing videos

Sequence:
- Use Shape Testing to determine if the particles are well separated by the thresholding functions
	and adjust their variables until that's true
	
- Use Shape Testing Multiple with a sample video with known classifications to determine
	characteristic bond lengths that separate configurations. You should transfer the thresholding
	parameters you found in Shape Testing
	
- Use Video Reader to count transitions in all the videos
	You need to transfer the classification scheme and the bond lengths you found in Shape 
	Testing Multiple into Video Reader (or export and import them as a function).
	
- Process the results using Matrix Multiplication to see the inferred bond strengths and transition
	times from the sample. 
	
- To determine what level of error you incurred with a particular pair of stability/transition thresholds
	(), run Matrix_Error, using a video where the number of transitions is known and where a variety
	of transitions (break apart, hinge, multiple states, some same-state) occur. Tweak these
	to get a reasonable distribution of transition times (implying no transition of a certain lengtth
	is missed), while keeping the error in the recorded proportion of each transition kind low.
